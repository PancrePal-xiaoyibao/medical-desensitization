# Security and privacy notes

This project handles medical records and other sensitive personal data. Treat all pasted text, uploaded files, OCR output, speech transcripts, and AI prompts as private health information.

## Data handling

- The frontend extracts PDF text and image OCR text in the browser before sending text to the Go backend for desensitization.
- The Go backend does not persist original medical text, uploaded file contents, OCR text, or desensitized output by default.
- Third-party chat, STT, and TTS providers are called only when the related feature is used and configured through backend environment variables.
- Do not enable `LOG_LEVEL=debug` with real patient data unless the deployment logs are access controlled and have a defined retention policy.
- Do not commit `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.keys`, certificates, recordings, screenshots, exported Markdown, or sample medical records that contain real personal information.

## Dependency advisories

As of 2026-05-06, `npm audit` reports a moderate PostCSS advisory through the current latest `next@16.2.4` dependency chain. Do not run `npm audit fix --force`; npm currently suggests a breaking downgrade path. Keep Dependabot enabled and upgrade Next.js when a non-breaking patched release becomes available.

## Deployment checklist

- Protect the `main` branch before enabling automatic dependency merges.
- Store provider keys only in backend environment variables or deployment secrets.
- Set `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the exact production frontend origin.
- Review `MAX_DESENSITIZE_BODY_BYTES` and `MAX_DESENSITIZE_FILE_BYTES` for the expected upload size.
- Confirm whether generated exports should be stored, downloaded, or deleted after use in your operating process.
